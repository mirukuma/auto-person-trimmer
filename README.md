```bash
$ python3 ./main.py ./images/input/ ./images/output/
```
Processes all images in `./images/input/` and outputs the results to `./images/output/`.

## What is this
It has limited uses, but it works well for most illustrations where the background is transparent or pure white and the people do not overlap. This tool would also be useful for collecting Deep Learning datasets.

## Demo
